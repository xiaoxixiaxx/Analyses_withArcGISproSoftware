# Analyses in Educational Equity Through Educational Opportunity Index Using Arc GIS PRO software
## - The Geographic landscape of Educational Opportunity in King County

## Introduction
The report describes the geographic distribution of educational quality in King County, Seattle, Washington. The quality of education is scored in five aspects: reading test scores, math test scores, student poverty, teacher qualifications, graduation rates. Each measure of educational quality is analyzed statistically, breaking it down into five levels. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of the five criteria is made to show the level and geographical distribution. Moreover, the report discusses the relationship between different levels of educational opportunity and geography and discusses the potential opportunities of geography for education.

## Explanation of the potential of opportunity mapping

By using opportunity mapping to reflect the education situation in King County, we can clearly see which of the five aspects of education is the weakest and see the distribution of the weak education in a specific area. Reflecting education on the map and combine the level of education with the geographical environment. Geographic regions may be responsible for educational differences. The level of education is related to the community, and the specific reasons for the weakness of education are analyzed. So, take the lessons of well-educated communities and learn from them. Through opportunity mapping, the community with weak education is shown and analyzed in combination with the social environment of the community. Thus, arouse the concern of government, society, enterprises, and other relevant organizations.

## Explanation of the five variables and details the measurement or operationalized. 

The quality of education is measured in reading test scores, math test scores, student poverty, teacher qualifications, and graduation rates. The reading test and math test scores are the compass test used to enter schools in the United States. They are essential basic skills for students in school and in life. In addition, much of the literature shows that student achievement and graduation rates are related to their poverty. Some learning opportunities, resources, and after-school programs are usually available to high-income children. Poor areas are still vulnerable groups in terms of school conditions. Poverty affects children's academic performance and makes it difficult for them to learn. Student graduation rates are a true reflection of the quality of education. Moreover, teachers' teaching methods, educational background and teaching experience have a direct impact on students' performance. Therefore, these five variables become the criteria for evaluating the comprehensive education.

Z-score is usually used to calculate the educational opportunity index, which is a measure that quantifies the distance a data point is from the mean of a data set. The use of Z-scores allows data a census tract to be measures based on its relative distance from the reginal average. In the calculation of educational opportunity index, I used Census Tract in King County. First, import the data of the five variables of the education index into AcrGIS, and then calculate the Z-scores of each variable respectively in the attribute according to Z-scores = (Observation -mean)/standard deviation. Next, calculate the average value of 5 Z-scores. Quintile classification was performed on the five variables by statistical method. The variable will be grouped into quintiles - lowest 20%, next 20% and so on. Then the Quintile Classification is divided into 5 parts as 1 – Very low, 2 -- Low, 3 -- Moderate, 4 -- High, and 5 – Very high using Python’s “if else” and then fill in attribute of Index column.

## Discussion of each of the 5 individual measures
### Edu1: Reading test scores

#### In the geographic distribution of reading test scores, the area with very low opportunity performance is in the southwest part of King County. They are clustered. It seems to match the geographic distribution of math test scores. with both very low chances distributed in the same area. In addition, the reading test distribution shows that the area with the greatest opportunity is northern King County. The entire eastern part of King County performed well, showing no declines opportunity.

### Edu2: Math test scores

#### In the geographic distribution of math test scores, the area of low opportunity remains the southwestern part of King County. They are clustered. This opportunity map is very similar to Edu1. These math scores are surrounded by low reading scores. Areas of high opportunity are concentrated in northern and central King County. The east is doing well. As with Edu1, there is an exception area. While the north presents a high chance, one region presents a very low opportunity. This area is surrounded by the surrounding high-opportunity area. The interesting connection between high opportunity and low opportunity is that the low opportunity is in the southern part of King County where the blocks are dense, and the high opportunity is in the eastern suburbs.

### Edu3: Student poverty
![Edu3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77243665/120547974-a418ac80-c3a6-11eb-9cef-9634abf7b8b8.png)
#### This shows the distribution of student poverty. On the map, very poor areas are in the southeast corner of King County, a dense area of blocks. This region also shows very low opportunities in the map above. They are clustered. Poor areas are overlapped by areas with low opportunities in reading and math tests. In addition, the areas with the lowest poverty index are in the northern part of King County, areas with high scores in reading and math.

### Edu4: Teacher qualifications

#### This map shows the qualifications of teachers. The area of very low opportunity is the northeast corner of King County. The area where the opportunity is very high is in the southeast corner. They are not clustered. The distribution of the data is decentralized. The degree of dispersion is particularly evident in Seattle's dense city blocks. These distributions are irregular. Low and high opportunities are mixed.

### Edu5: Graduation rates
![Edu5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77243665/120548007-b0046e80-c3a6-11eb-9a26-4ac072720979.png)
#### In this map showing student graduation rates, the large eastern portion of King County presents high opportunities. The south-eastern region presents low opportunity. They are all clustered. Low-opportunity areas remain in Seattle's dense neighborhoods and southwest.

Compare the five maps, Edu1 (reading test scores), Edu2 (math test scores), and Edu5 (graduation rates), which share similar geography. The Edu3 (Student Poverty) map shows the geography of almost the opposite of their three maps. Edu4 (Teacher Qualification) does not share the same geography. We are not just measuring the same variation 5 times over. There are interesting discrepancies between the measures. Poverty affects students' reading test scores, math test scores, and graduation rates. Opportunities are lower in poorer areas than in richer ones. Location influences children's education. However, teacher qualifications are not the most important factor affecting the quality of education. The opportunity mapping shows how geography affects educational equity.

## Discussion of the composite index map 
![EduOppIndex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77243665/120548012-b397f580-c3a6-11eb-9ead-4f0c69821db5.png)

The map combines five variables to show King County's educational opportunity index, which is measured by reading and math test scores, student poverty, teacher qualifications, and graduation rates. As described above, Z-scores for each variable are calculated separately in the properties. After the average value of the 5 Z-scores is calculated, the Quintile classification of the 5 variables is carried out into 5 levels by statistical method. The educational opportunity index inverts the variables. The most obvious is in the northeast corner of the map. It was shown as the area with the lowest educational opportunities. The district has high opportunities for reading, math and graduation rates, low opportunities for teaching qualifications, and low opportunities for student’s poverty. Converting this district to a low educational opportunity index is due to low teacher qualification opportunities. In addition, the southwest corner (it seems around Kent, Renton, Tukwila, Tacoma, and SeaTac) is unsurprisingly low on the educational opportunity index. This is an area where the opportunities of variables are low. So, the composite index is still low. And East of Bellevue is a special geographical location, which presents very low educational opportunities and is surrounded by areas with high opportunities. Moreover, the Northwest Corner and the Southeast Corner present a moderate educational opportunity index. The central part of King County, the suburbs of the city, and the areas around Bellevue, Redmond, Redmond Ridge, Issaquah, and Snoqualmie present a very high educational opportunity index.

The educational system of low opportunity students, who lack an adequate number of teachers. The school's teaching facilities are poor. There are not enough after-school programs to support education. Due to poverty, some children's families are not able to support their interest cultivation, or even provide stationery and books for study. Guess the student system with high chance. They have enough highly educated teachers with rich teaching experience and have high-tech teaching hardware and software facilities. The school provides teaching assistants to help them solve problems in their homework. In addition, they have more opportunities to develop extracurricular projects and personal interests. There is a big difference between students with low educational opportunities and high opportunities.

## Conclusion

The educational opportunities mappings and report use data from the school districts of each census district in King County. This report introduces the geographical distribution of education quality in King County by combining five variables. The report details the measurements and calculations. Each variable was analyzed separately. Also, the overall quality of education is analyzed. The opportunity mapping reveals the geographical location of opportunity, reflects the quality and equity of education in King County, and shows how different groups of people are concentrated in areas with low or high opportunities. To effectively increase the opportunities for the low educational opportunity index area, to attract the attention of social institutions, enterprises, and the government, and to make the educational opportunities in King County more equitable.
